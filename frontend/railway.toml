# Railway config-as-code for the app (frontend) service.
# Used when this service is deployed from source (GitHub, template, or `railway up`).
# Configuration here overrides dashboard settings for each deployment.
#
# Note: When the app is created by importing deploy/railway/docker-compose.yml
# and uses the pre-built image (no source deploy), this file is not used — set
# the pre-deploy command once in Railway dashboard (Settings > Deploy > Pre-deploy Command).

[deploy]
# Run DB migrations before each deploy so auth (users, sessions) tables exist.
